Trainer
=======

Go tool that serves as a running training companion.
With this tool, you can quantify the impact of your training on your
running performance.

This is my workflow:

1. Synchronize garmin watch to garmin connect app
2. Strava is connected to garmin connect and receives the activity
3. Once in strava, give a name to the activity (i.e long-run, tempo run, easy run, race...)
4. Bulk export Strava to my e-mail via their privacy options
5. Analyze downloaded data with this tool

If you name your activities in a consistent way, this tool allows you to filter and analyze
performance between activities of the same kind (i.e compare evolution of performance on long-runs only)

Ideally I would like Garmin to let me securely connect to their API
and synchronize the files this way. Sadly Garmin wants you to pay a one time 4.000$ fee
to get access to their API.
